# PHP Prime

In one way I would not want you to use this framework, as I'm sure there are better frameworks out there which have a community of developers behind them.

However, please have a look at what it can do, and how that compares to other frameworks.

This framework is intended for rapid development of websites, where focus is on the elements that appear on the pages (forms, data tables, shopping carts, etc).

For example, a typical website will just have a number of forms, and they are the primary/only dynamic elements.

While the framework does use a form of MVC, it is more so for code organisation rather than trying to be "theoretically perfect"... I want to build websites/systems fast and well, rather than spending weeks debating if a OO Singleton should be allowed (I do use singletons for things like the website config, because it makes the code easier to read/write).

For details, see the [PHP Prime website](http://www.phpprime.com/).
