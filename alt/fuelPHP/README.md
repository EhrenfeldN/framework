#Am I a Fuck-Tard?

This is a silly project site that is meant as a demonstration of [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com/) in action. It struggles a little
with the Twitter hourly limit, but if I waste too much time on this project then I won't be able to do anything fun on the FuelPHP framework itself!

##Development Team
