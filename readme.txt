Perhaps a route could also trigger a function to be called... for admin authentication perhaps?

Can a service register a gateway... e.g. payments in /a/api/payment/(st|wp|pp|gc)/

Original suggested folder structure

	/app/
		/controller/
		/controller_template/
		/controller_helper/ <-- e.g. a store locator
		/view/
		/view_element/ <-- Elements that can be used on a page, e.g. a map for a store
		/view_layout/ <-- Main HTML layouts
		/model/
		/model_behaviour/
