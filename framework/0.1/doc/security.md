The main security problem with all websites is how [strings of characters](../doc/security/strings.md) are handled.

Once you have a good understanding of [strings](../doc/security/strings.md), then you can cover some of the finer points of web security:

* [Strings](../doc/security/strings.md) - yes, it is really important.
* [Cross site request forgery](../doc/security/csrf.md) - aka CSRF.
* [Cross site scripting](../doc/security/xss.md) - aka XSS.
* [Site framing](../doc/security/framing.md) - used in click jacking.
* [Strict transport security](../doc/security/transport.md) - to avoid "man in the middle" attacks.
* [Content security policy](../doc/security/csp.md) - for added protection against XSS.
* [Login and passwords](../doc/security/logins.md) - when authenticating users.
* [File uploads](../doc/security/files.md) - and what happens to those files.
