The main security problem with all websites is how [strings of characters](/doc/security/strings/) are handled.

Once you have a good understanding of [strings](/doc/security/strings/), then you can cover some of the finer points of web security:

* [Strings](/doc/security/strings/) - yes, its really important.
* [Cross site request forgery](/doc/security/csrf/) - aka CSRF.
* [Site framing](/doc/security/framing/) - used in click jacking.
* [Strict transport security](/doc/security/transport/) - to avoid "man in the middle" attacks.
* [Content security policy](/doc/security/csp/) - for added protection against XSS.
* [Login and passwords](/doc/security/logins/) - when authenticating users.
* [File uploads](/doc/security/files/) - and what happens to those files.
