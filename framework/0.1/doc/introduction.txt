PHP Prime is a basic framework, which is loosely based on the MVC structure.

Where the typical page is built using the URL, e.g.

	http://www.example.com/admin/news/edit/123/

If your just adding a HTML page, then you just need to create a [view file](/doc/setup/views/) such as:

	/app/view/admin/news/edit.ctp

		<h1>Edit Article</h1>

		<?= $form->html(); ?>

In this example we have the variable `$form`, which is a [form helper](/doc/helpers/form/).

To setup these and other variables, you can create a [controller](/doc/setup/controllers/), for example:

	/app/controller/admin/news.php

	<?php

		class admin_news_controller extends controller {

			public function action_edit($id = NULL) {

				$form = new form();

				// Code for the edit page

				$this->set('form', $form);

			}

		}

	?>

If you are running the website in [development mode](/doc/setup/config/), PHP Prime will add some [notes](/doc/setup/debug/) to help explain how the request was handled and where it looked for the controller.

Finally this output is added to a [template](/doc/setup/templates/), which is where the common HTML for the website is added (such as the site navigation).

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="<?= html(config::get('output.lang')) ?>">
	<head>
		<?= $this->head_get_html() ?>
	</head>
	<body id="<?= html($this->page_ref_get()) ?>">

		<h1><?= html($this->title_get()) ?></h1>

		<div id="page_nav">

			<?= $nav->html(); ?>

		</div>

		<div id="page_content">

			<?= $this->message_get_html() ?>

			<?= $this->view_get_html() ?>

		</div>

	</body>
	</html>

And yes I use the '[echo shortcut](http://www.php.net/echo)', which is not the same as 'short tags' as of PHP 5.4.

From here I urge you to at least scan over the notes on [security](/doc/security/), which applies to all websites/frameworks.

You will also notice that when you are in [development mode](/doc/setup/config/), not only do you get the helper notes, the page loads with the XML header to ensure your HTML is pretty strict, and the [CSP header](/doc/security/csp/) is enabled and enforced.

Now your free to [start using the framework](/doc/setup/).
