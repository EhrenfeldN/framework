# Debug

This really only comes into play when your in development mode (see below).

However there are some useful functions which are always present:

	debug($var);

# Development mode

You can enable this by either setting the `SERVER` constant to 'stage', or the via the config:

	define('SERVER', 'stage');

	$config['debug.level'] = 4;

When enabled all HTML pages should get a little bit of [debug information](/doc/setup/debug/) at the bottom of the page.

A copy of the site config is shown in the [C] notes.
