# Views

Named to match the usual convention in MVC frameworks, a "view" is simply the unique content (HTML) that appears on the page.

If the page is going to have some dynamic content, such as the details of a product (in the case of an online store), then typically the information is first returned by the [controller](/doc/setup/controllers/).
