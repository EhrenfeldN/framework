Otherwise known as "Create Read Update and Delete", crud is typically used in an admin control panel where to edit a set of records.

Provides an index page (search form, pagination, table, add link - order of which can be changed), edit/add page (fields to be editable, and can have custom elements, or a child-record editing feature), and delete page.

Config includes pointing it to a model... if the model does not exist, a generic one is created for that table name.
